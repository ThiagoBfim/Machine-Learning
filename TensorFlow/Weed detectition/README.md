## ML Project  for Weed detectition

This project use [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fpeccia/weed-detection-in-soybean-crops) to predict weed detection in soybean crops.

This project contains tree files, one with Keras, other with Neural Network from scratch, and other with pre-trained model(MobileNet)
